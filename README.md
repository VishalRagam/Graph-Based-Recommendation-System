Designed and implemented a recommendation engine leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNN), specifically GraphSAGE, to capture complex relationships between users and items. Modeled the user-item interaction data as a bipartite graph and trained the system to generate personalized recommendations. Utilized NetworkX, PyTorch Geometric, and Pandas for graph construction, feature engineering, and model training. Achieved improved recommendation accuracy over traditional collaborative filtering methods.
